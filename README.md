# Aditi-s-Inquiry

Day 1 - Since I'm still indecisive, I went and searched up for ideas for what I could with Java. I came across many interestings things, such as economic applications like an airline reservation system and management systems as well. Though I didn't really come across anything on games, I found out that Java is heavily employed in creating Android apps.

Day 2 - The goals for today were to wrap up brainstorming and get deeper into research, as well as start some of the coding. The project will most likely be a simulator or a story game of some sorts. Something that I would definitely want to implement in the game is graphics, as it's something I haven't had much exposure to in Java and would be something I could learn more about through this project. For the IDE, I decided to use repl.it, as it would make it easier to work on this project from home. I will continue documentation through Schoology and Github, as well as updates on Trello. Currently, brainstorming is over, and now planning and research are in progress, and will continue on forth while the project is being coded.

Day 3 - Today I wanted to get going with planning, and to decide what my final project is going to be, as well as start pseudocode for the non-graphics part of the game. I have determined my project will be a zombie apocalype simulator. As previously stated, I am using repl as an ID for convenience reasons, and am working on planning the game, and continuing to research on Java graphics.

Day 4 - Today was just a day to continue to work on pseudocode and just that. I'm still working on it, but it's going along pretty well. I'm not sure how long the game should be, and I don't know if adding 2D Animation graphics is a possibility. I've started putting up some of the pseudocode on repl. 

Day 5 - Still working on pseudocode.

Day 6 - Working on pseudocode, started planning out how graphics will look like. Also experimenting with different graphics with Java Swing. Still using repl as an IDE.

Day 7 - Put in some of the text, still no graphics yet. Trying to find a way to display text in frame and not in the console.

Day 8 - Started putting in graphics. Might try using the JLabel method to display text in the frame.

Day 9 - While the JLabel method does work, it doesn't show the entire text I want to put, so I'm trying to find a text command that can show longer strings.

Day 10 - In addition to making silly mistakes, I know what I was doing in creating the rest of the project, though keeping track of parantheses and curly braces was definitely confusing and caused me to make countless tiny errors that could have messed up the entire program. I also added many instances of the Item and Zombie classes, even though I only incorporated two subclasses of Item. The reason for this was because these were things I wanted to implement in a potentially longer version of the game. I would say this project really pushed me out of my confort zone because even though I was programming with a language similar to Java, the added graphics and getting used to having things run in the Console instead of the shell were a challenge for me. In addition, I feel that repl.it was not the best IDE to use for this as it has a different way of marking Java errors than other text editors, and it was very laggy in loading the program. Java Swing was also a little bit troublesome tp work with, as it is an old language and has not really progressed in terms of modern technology, and in general, Java isn't really suited for graphics. If I were to do this project again, I would spend less time planning out the story and more so focus on getting acquainted with Java Swing. I can say that from this project, I have a slightly better understanding of Java graphics and how software applications are made.
